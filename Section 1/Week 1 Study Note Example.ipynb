    "In the context of physical systems and system dynamics, **input** and **output** refer to the interactions of the system with its environment. Here's a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Input**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Inputs are external signals, forces, or stimuli applied to a system that cause it to change its behavior or state. They represent how energy, information, or matter is introduced into the system.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Mechanical Systems**: Applied force or torque.\n",
    "  - **Electrical Systems**: Voltage or current.\n",
    "  - **Thermal Systems**: Heat or temperature difference.\n",
    "  - **Biological Systems**: Nutrients or signaling molecules.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Inputs act as a control or disturbance to the system, often used to influence or test the system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Outputs are the measurable responses or results produced by a system as a consequence of its inputs. They represent how the system interacts with or affects its environment.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Mechanical Systems**: Displacement, velocity, or acceleration.\n",
    "  - **Electrical Systems**: Voltage across a resistor or current through a circuit.\n",
    "  - **Thermal Systems**: Heat flow or temperature.\n",
    "  - **Biological Systems**: Growth rate or hormonal levels.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Outputs provide information about the system's performance, state, or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Relationship Between Input and Output**\n",
    "- The input and output of a system are related by its internal dynamics, often represented by mathematical models such as **differential equations**, **transfer functions**, or **state-space representations**.\n",
    "- The relationship can also depend on:\n",
    "  - **Linear vs. Nonlinear Behavior**: In linear systems, the output is proportional to the input. Nonlinear systems exhibit more complex input-output relationships.\n",
    "  - **Time Dependency**: Dynamic systems produce outputs that depend on both current and past inputs due to memory effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Physical Example**\n",
    "#### **Mass-Spring-Damper System**\n",
    "- **Input**: External force applied to the mass.\n",
    "- **Output**: Displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Electrical RLC Circuit**\n",
    "- **Input**: Voltage source applied to the circuit.\n",
    "- **Output**: Current through a component or voltage across a specific element.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **What is a Physical System?**\n",
    "A physical system is anything you want to study or control that follows physical laws, like:\n",
    "- A car moving on a road.\n",
    "- A fan spinning when you switch it on.\n",
    "- Water flowing through a pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand or control a system, we study:\n",
    "1. **What goes into the system?** (Input)\n",
    "2. **What comes out of the system?** (Output)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Input?**\n",
    "The **input** is something you give to the system to make it do something or to test how it behaves. Think of it as the “cause.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- In a car, the **input** is the force you apply on the accelerator pedal (or fuel injected into the engine).\n",
    "- For a fan, the **input** is the electricity supplied to it.\n",
    "- In a sound system, the **input** is your voice or a song played through a microphone or a device.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Output?**\n",
    "The **output** is what the system gives back to you after processing the input. Think of it as the “effect.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- In a car, the **output** is how fast the car moves (its speed or acceleration).\n",
    "- For a fan, the **output** is the airflow it produces.\n",
    "- In a sound system, the **output** is the sound you hear from the speakers.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **A Simple Real-Life Example**\n",
    "Imagine you're watering a plant using a water tap and a hose:\n",
    "1. **Input**: You open the tap to let water flow into the hose.\n",
    "2. **System**: The hose delivers the water to the plant.\n",
    "3. **Output**: Water comes out of the hose and reaches the plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Connects Input and Output?**\n",
    "The system itself connects the input to the output. It’s like the middleman that processes the input and gives you the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- In the water hose, the hose acts as the system that transfers water (input) to the plant (output).\n",
    "- In a car, the engine processes the fuel (input) to produce speed (output).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Idea for Beginners**\n",
    "The input is what you **control** or **apply** to the system, and the output is what you **observe** or **get** from the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this important?\n",
    "- By studying input and output, we can predict and control how systems behave.\n",
    "- Engineers use this knowledge to design systems that work efficiently and safely.\n",

    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **Input**:\n",
    "   - The **input** to a system is what you control or provide to influence the system's behavior.\n",
    "   - In the case of the rocket, the **thrust force from the rocket engine** is the driving factor that determines how the rocket moves. It is generated by the combustion of fuel and is directly applied to propel the rocket upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output**:\n",
    "   - The **altitude of the rocket** and the **velocity of the rocket** are both measurable outcomes (responses) of the system. They depend on the thrust force and other factors, such as gravity, air resistance, and the rocket’s mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Idea**:\n",
    "- The **thrust force** is the **cause** (input).\n",
    "- The **altitude** and **velocity** are the **effects** (outputs) that result from the thrust applied to the rocket.\n",
